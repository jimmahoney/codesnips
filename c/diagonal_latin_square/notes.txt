Diagonal Latin Square 

 From Puzzle Corner in July/Aug Techology Review :
   Find an 8x8 grid of the numbers 1 to 8 such that
   there are no duplicates in same row, column, or diagonal.
   (Diagonals don't wrap.)

Each digit satisfies the classic "8-queens" problem,
so one way to do this is to find eight of these 
solutions (one for each digit) that don't overlap.

Running the C code in this directory shows that there 
are 92 solutions to the 8-queens problem.

If all are laid on top of each other, here are how many
queens there are in each cell:

    4    8   16   18   18   16    8    4
    8   16   14    8    8   14   16    8
   16   14    4   12   12    4   14   16
   18    8   12    8    8   12    8   18
   18    8   12    8    8   12    8   18
   16   14    4   12   12    4   14   16
    8   16   14    8    8   14   16    8
    4    8   16   18   18   16    8    4

The product of these along any row or main diagonal
gives one limit on a brute-force search.

Looks like the diagonal is the smallest :
 4 * 16 * 4 * 8 * 8 * 4 * 16 * 4 = 4194304 ~ 4.2e6
which seems like a searchable size.

In fact, the diagonal numbers imply that we must
choose our subset of n-queens solutions from among
fewer than the 92, since (unlike the n-queens)
there must be one of each digit along the main
diagonal.  Thus we need only consider the solutions
that include a number on the diagonal, which are 
(4 + 16 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 16 + 4) = 64.

And we have two diagonals.  Are they the same 64?
We need consider only the intersection of those two sets,
which contain 48 solutions.

I don't see a clever way to reduce the problem further
without searching.  Brute force requires looking 
at C(48, 8) = choose 8 from 48 = 48*47*...*41 
= 15214711438080 = 1.5e13, which is pretty big.

This looks like a prime candidate for the Dancing Links
version of Knuth's Algorith X, which solves the exact 
cover problem :

 * The exact cover matrix will be 48 x 64 matrix , namely

                  0,0  0,1  0,2 ... 7,7  = row,col on 8x8 board
    solution  1     *    *    * ...   *
    solution  2     *    *    * ...   *
    solution  3   ...
     ...          ...
    solution 48   ...

 * Each column is one of the 64 squares in the 8x8 grid.
 * Each row is one of the 48 n-queens solutions that have
   a queen in each main diagonal.
 * Put a 1 where a given permuation has a queen in that 
   square, and a 0 where it doesn't; therefore there are 
   eight 1's in each row.

Then the "exact cover" problem is to find a subset of the rows
such that there is a single 1 in each column.  That subset will 
be the eight solutions that we want.

... and it fails right away.  
The (row=0, col=1) cell only has three solutions; 
doing the dancing links reduction on each of those
leads to matrix which has all zeros in one of the columns.

So unless I've made a mistake, there isn't a solution.
