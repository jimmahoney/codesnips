Diagonal Latin Square 

 See ./notes.txt for a discussion of the problem.

 The code is in this directory and several nearby :
   ./dls.c                     diagonal latin square in C, n=8
   ./n_dls.c                   diagonal latin square in C, search over n
   ../permute/*                permutation generator
   ../n_queens/*               N-queens on an NxN board code
   ../dancing_links/*          Knuth's exact cover algorithm

 To compile and run 'em :
   1. First run "make" in each of the 
      directories (permute, n_queens, dancing_links)
      to create permute.o, n_queens.o, dancing_links.o .
   2. Then in this directory :
        $ make
        $ ./dls
        $ ./n_dls
