 A minimum binary heap implementation in C.

 For an explanation of what this is, see e.g.
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap

 To understand how this one can be used, see
  * the API in minheap.h and 
  * the code in test_minheap.c.

 To compile and run the tests from the command line:
   $ make test_minheap
   $ ./test_minheap
